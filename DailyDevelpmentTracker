🔒 User Authentication

Implemented User Registration (React + Spring Boot)

Profile picture upload

User saved to DB with default role CANDIDATE

approved set to false by default

Profile picture saved with unique filename

Implemented User Login Page (app/login/page.tsx)

API call to Spring Boot login endpoint

JWT token stored in localStorage

Error handling and validation done

Successful login redirects to /dashboard

Integrated React Frontend with Backend:

Backend: http://localhost:8080

Frontend: http://localhost:3000

Registration and login now fully functional with backend integration

🛡️ Backend Login Endpoint

POST /api/auth/login

Validates email & password

Checks if user is approved

Generates JWT token on success

Sends token + user info to frontend

📁 Code Structure Aligned

Created and connected:

UserController

UserService

UserRepository

DTOs and response models created as needed

🟡 In Progress

🔐 Route Protection (Frontend)

Not yet implemented: ProtectedRoute.tsx

Todo:

Validate JWT on page access

Redirect unauthorized users to login

🖥️ Dashboard Page (/dashboard)

Basic redirect in place after login

Todo:

Layout and menu

Display logged-in user data

Link to profile update / email config

⏭️ Next Steps (Planned)

🧑‍💼 Add Admin approval UI:

/admin/unapproved-users endpoint + React view

Approve/reject user functionality

📝 Implement profile management (/profile)

Update email/app password

Custom email body

Upload CV/cover letter again if needed

✉️ Allow sending emails only after admin approval

🔧 Logback logging fixes (file-based logging)

🧪 Finalize JUnit + Mockito tests for auth

☁️ Prepare for deployment (cloud-ready/Tomcat setup)

📝 Notes

Using Spring Boot + React (Next.js 13+)

React dev server: npm run dev

Email is sent only if user is approved

JWT required to protect routes after login

📌 File Paths

React: /app/login/page.tsx, /app/signup/page.tsx

Backend: UserService.java, UserController.java, UserRepository.java, AuthController.java

Got it ✅
I’ll prepare the Spring Boot + JWT + Security skeleton for you so tomorrow we can integrate it into your existing admin/user flow.

Here’s what I’ll prepare for you:

Spring Boot JWT & Security Plan
Dependencies

Spring Boot Web

Spring Security

JWT (jjwt library)

Spring Data JPA (already in your project)

Security Config

Configure stateless security.

Allow /auth/login, /auth/register without authentication.

Protect all other /api/** routes.

Add JwtAuthenticationFilter.

JWT Utility

Generate token with:

id

email

role

adminId (if exists)

Validate token.

Authentication Controller

/auth/login → validate user → return token + role + adminId.

/auth/register → allow new user creation.

Frontend

Store JWT token in localStorage.

Send token in Authorization header (Bearer <token>).

Decode token to get adminId & role.

📌 Tomorrow’s Goal

Replace your current login flow with JWT.

Admin flow works automatically based on adminId from token.

User can only access their own interviews.

If you want, I can write the ready-to-paste code for:

SecurityConfig.java

JwtUtil.java

JwtAuthenticationFilter.java

Updated AuthController.java

so you just integrate it tomorrow.

Do you want me to make that code package now?
